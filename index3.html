    <br>
    <img src="images/page 4 first image.webp">
    <p>Ramanujan's contribution extends to mathematical fields such as complex analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions.</p>
    <p><b style="color: brown;">Infinite series for pi</b>: In 1914, Ramanujan found a formula for infinite series for pi, which forms the basis of many algorithms used today. Finding an <i>accurate approximation of π (pi)</i>has been one of the most important challenges in the history of mathematics.</p>
    <p><b style="color: brown;">Game theory</b>: Ramanujan discovered a long list of new ideas for solving many challenging mathematical problems that have given great impetus to the development of game theory. His contribution to game theory is purely based on intuition and natural talent and is unmatched to this day.</p>
    <p><b style="color: brown;">Mock theta function</b>: He elaborated on the mock theta function,  a concept in the field of modular forms of mathematics.</p>
    <p><b style="color: brown;">Ramanujan number</b>: 1729 is known as the Ramanujan number which is the sum of the cubes of two numbers 10 and 9.</p>
    <p><b style="color: brown;">Circle Method</b>: Ramanujan, along with GH Hardy, invented the circle method which gave the first approximations of the partition of numbers beyond 200. This method contributed significantly to solving the notorious complex problems of the 20th century, such as Waring's conjecture and other additional questions.</p>
    <p><b style="color: brown;">Theta Function</b>: Theta function is a special function of several complex variables. German mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi invented several closely related theta functions known as Jacobi theta functions. Theta function was studied by extensively Ramanujan who came up with the Ramanujan theta function, that generalizes the form of Jacobi theta functions and also captures general properties. Ramanujan theta function is used to determine the critical dimensions in Bosonic string theory, superstring theory, and M-theory.</p>
    <p style="background-color: bisque;">Other notable contributions by Ramanujan include hypergeometric series, the Riemann series, the elliptic integrals, the theory of divergent series, and the functional equations of the zeta function.

       <P style="background-color: bisque;"> Ramanujan‘s achievements were all about elegance, depth, and surprise beautifully intertwined. Unfortunately, Ramanujan contracted a fatal illness in England in 1918.  He convalesced there for more than a year and returned to India in 1919. His condition then worsened,  and he died on 26 April  1920. One might expect that a dying man would stop working and await his fate.  However,  Ramanujan spent his last year producing some of his most profound mathematics. </P>
        
       <p> It has been more than a century, however, his mathematical discoveries are still alive and flourishing. "Ramanujan is important not just as a mathematician but because of what he tells us that the human mind can do”. "Someone with his ability is so rare and so precious that we can't afford to lose them. A genius can arise anywhere in the world.  It is our good fortune that he was one of us.  It is unfortunate that too little of Ramanujan’s life and work, esoteric though the latter is, seems to be known to most of us".</p>
