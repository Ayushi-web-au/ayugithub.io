    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large; color: brown;">WHO WAS RAMANUJAN ?</h1>
    <p style="color: blue;">
        April 27, 2016</p>
       <p style="font-style: italic;"> This week’s release of the movie The Man Who Knew Infinity (which I saw in rough form last fall through its mathematican-producers Manjul Bhargava and Ken Ono) leads me to write about its subject, Srinivasa Ramanujan…</p>
       <img src="images/page 3 first image.png">
       <p style="font-size: x-large; color: brown;">A Remarkable Letter</p>
        <p>They used to come by physical mail. Now it’s usually email. From around the world, I have for many years received a steady trickle of messages that make bold claims—about prime numbers, relativity theory, AI, consciousness or a host of other things—but give little or no backup for what they say. I’m always so busy with my own ideas and projects that I invariably put off looking at these messages. But in the end I try to at least skim them—in large part because I remember the story of Ramanujan.</p>
        
       <p> On about January 31, 1913 a mathematician named G. H. Hardy in Cambridge, England received a package of papers with a cover letter that began: “Dear Sir, I beg to introduce myself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department of the Port Trust Office at Madras on a salary of only £20 per annum. I am now about 23 years of age….” and went on to say that its author had made “startling” progress on a theory of divergent series in mathematics, and had all but solved the longstanding problem of the distribution of prime numbers. The cover letter ended: “Being poor, if you are convinced that there is anything of value I would like to have my theorems published…. Being inexperienced I would very highly value any advice you give me. Requesting to be excused for the trouble I give you. I remain, Dear Sir, Yours truly, S. Ramanujan”.</p>
        
        <p>What followed were at least 11 pages of technical results from a range of areas of mathematics (at least 2 of the pages have now been lost). There are a few things that on first sight might seem absurd, like that the sum of all positive integers can be thought of as being equal to –1/12:</p>

       <P style="font-size: larger;">Then there are statements that suggest a kind of experimental approach to mathematics:</P>
       <img src="images/page 3 fourth image.png">
       <p style="font-size: larger;">But some things get more exotic, with pages of formulas like this:</p>
       <img src="images/page 3 fifth image.png">
       <p>What are these? Where do they come from? Are they even correct?</p>

        <p>The concepts are familiar from college-level calculus. But these are not just complicated college-level calculus exercises. Instead, when one looks closely, each one has something more exotic and surprising going on—and seems to involve a quite different level of mathematics.</p
            >
        
        <p>Today we can use Mathematica or Wolfram|Alpha to check the results—at least numerically. And sometimes we can even just type in the question and immediately get out the answer:
        
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/page 3 sixth image.png">
        <p>And the first surprise—just as G. H. Hardy discovered back in 1913—is that, yes, the formulas are essentially all correct. But what kind of person would have made them? And how? And are they all part of some bigger picture—or in a sense just scattered random facts of mathematics?</p>
